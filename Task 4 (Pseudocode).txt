    DECLARE input : String
    DECLARE char1, highChar : Character
    DECLARE maxCount : Integer

PRINT("Enter String: ")
Input <=== INPUT       

DECLARE highCount(Len(Input)) : Integer

For count <=== 1 To Len(Input)

    char1 <=== Mid(Input, count, 1)
    highCount(count) <=== Input.Count(Function(x) LCase(x) = char1) 

    ' this "Input.Count(Function(x) LCase(x) = char1)" is the only
    ' statement which i dont know how it works. I got the correct count for the most appeared character however my code would
    ' display the wrong character even while showing the correct repeat count. So I searched stack overflow for a solution and
    ' found this line which works perfectly. This is also the only help i've taken from the internet in all of my 11 codes

    If highCount(count) > maxCount Then
        maxCount <=== highCount(count)
        highChar <=== Mid(Input, count, 1)
    End If
Next

PRINT("The character that appears the most is: '" & highChar & "' and it appears: '" & maxCount & "' times.")
